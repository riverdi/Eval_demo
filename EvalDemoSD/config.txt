display=70
eve=0


NOTE:
Above 2 lines set display size and display type.

First line 'display' determines display size.

Options are as below.

displays size:
3.5" =35
4.3" =43
5"   =50
7"   =70
10.1"  =101

e.g. please set display=70 for 7.0" display. 


Second line 'eve' determines if the display is an intelligent display with EVE4 controller on the board or a simple, bare LCD TFT with RGB/LVDS/MIPI interface.

eve=0 means display without EVE4 intelligent controller
eve=1 means display with EVE4 intelligent controller and the display should be connected directly to RiBUS on EVAL through FFC (without Don Addon).


WARNING: 
To evalaute bare 10.1" LCD TFT with LVDS interface, eve=1 is the only option. 
Because EVE4 controller is already on Don Addon 101.
